Color Detection from Images
In many creative and technical fields—such as graphic design, UI/UX, and digital art—precisely identifying colors from images is essential. The "Color Detection from Images" project is designed to help users detect and understand the color composition of an image in an intuitive and interactive way. Users can upload an image, click on any part of it, and immediately view the color name and RGB values of the selected pixel.

This tool leverages OpenCV for image handling and pixel detection, and uses a dataset of predefined color names and RGB values to find the closest color match. A visual box of the detected color is also displayed for reference. The application features a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit, making it accessible through the web without requiring installation.

It is especially useful for developers, designers, and accessibility testers who need quick, accurate color identification to maintain brand consistency, design clarity, or ensure accessibility compliance.
